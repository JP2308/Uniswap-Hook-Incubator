This repository contains all of my research, experiments, and projects from **The Atrium Academy’s Uniswap v4 Hook Incubator** — a deep technical program focused on mastering Uniswap v4 Core and building advanced Hooks in Solidity.

---

## 📘 Overview

**Uniswap v4 Hooks** introduce programmable logic that extends AMM behavior — allowing developers to modify pool creation, swaps, and liquidity operations in new ways.  

This repo serves as both a **technical archive** and **project portfolio**, mapping my progress through the incubator’s curriculum and culminating in my **capstone project**.

## 🧩 Key Projects

### 🧮 Volatility Fee Hook
> Dynamically adjusts swap fees based on short-term volatility — discouraging toxic order flow while rewarding stable LPs.  
📁 [`/hooks/volatility_fee_hook/`](./hooks/volatility_fee_hook)

### ⚖️ Liquidity Rebalancer Hook
> Automates LP position adjustments when price ranges drift — maintaining optimal utilization and passive income.  
📁 [`/hooks/liquidity_rebalancer_hook/`](./hooks/liquidity_rebalancer_hook)

### 🚀 Capstone Project — *[XXX]*
> My final project for the incubator, presented at Demo Day.  
> **Goal:** [XXX]  
📁 [`/hooks/capstone_project/`](./hooks/capstone_project)

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Deep understanding of **Uniswap v4 architecture**, including transient storage and the singleton pool manager.  
- Practical experience designing **on-chain market mechanisms** with dynamic, composable hooks.  
- Robust development and testing workflow with **Foundry**.  
- Exposure to **MEV-resistant**, **oracle-aware**, and **gas-optimized** design patterns.  
- Completion of a **capstone hook** deployed and presented during Demo Day.
